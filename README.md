# Non-coding rare variant project

This repository contains scripts for data processing, analysis and figure generation data for our preprint:
[Ribeiro DM, Delaneau O. bioRxiv (2023) Non-coding rare variant associations with blood traits on 166,740 UK Biobank genomes.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.01.569422v1)

## Repository folders:
- figures : contains R scripts for plotting all manuscript figures and source data for main figures
- jobs_readme : contains text files with local pipeline for data processing and analysis (either locally or on UK Biobank RAP)
- supporting_data : contains lists of traits, genes, and other useful info
- supporting_scripts : Rscripts or bash files used to process data and perform analysis (either locally or on UK Biobank RAP)

## Data availability
Genetic and phenotypic data from the UK Biobank can be accessed throught he UKB RAP platform.
